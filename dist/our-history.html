				<h2>Refrigerated Shipments</h2>
				<p>A trial shipment of frozen mutton and lamb was sent from Port Chalmers (Otago) to London on the refrigerated steamship Dunedin.   Meat, cheese and butter now joined wool as important export commodities, bringing a long period of economic growth that lasted – with occasional interruptions due to recession and depression – until the 1970s.</p>

				<h2>Highest Standards of Living</h2>
				<p>Exports exceeded imports. New Zealand – Britain’s farm in the South Pacific, as it was often called – enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the world.   Export income financed the development of New Zealand’s infrastructure (such as roads, railway lines, communication links, schools and electricity generation) as well as meeting the cost of essential imports such as motor vehicles, machinery and fuel.</p>

				<p>Britain joined the European Economic Community (now called the European Union), which meant it had to buy more of its goods from European countries. One of the conditions of its membership was that Britain put strict limits on imports from New Zealand, with the result that New Zealand suddenly lost much of its access to its most important market.</p>

				<h2>Economic Decline</h2>
				<p>New Zealand’s economic growth fell behind that of other developed countries during the 1970s and ‘80s and our relative standard of living declined as a result. For decades, we have had a stubbornly high current account deficit, meaning we have spent more on imports than we have earned from exports. In other words, we have been living beyond our means.</p>

				<h2>Tempted to move</h2>
				<p>When OECD membership had increased to 30 countries, New Zealand had slipped to 20th place. One of the dangers of this widening income gap between New Zealand and other countries is that more New Zealanders are tempted to move to other countries, such as Australia, in search of better economic opportunities.</p>
